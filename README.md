A personal project, in which I will play around with different features, libraries and concepts of Rust. It is unfinished and constantly evolving. 

The app itself is rendering homage to a favourite game of my youth. It was one of those early online games, in which a large number of players would compete with one another. Devoid of any graphics, these gems focused on the essentials, that is, player-interaction and core mechanics. The rise of MMORPGs put an end to them. As I find myself reminiscing about these games and times so fondly, I would enjoy providing a similarly essential experience within a console application. :)

The current version contains the very core of the app consisting of a thread running a tui terminal, another running a crossterm event listener and a third running a game-loop. You can start the game, access different menues and quit it. 

The next steps will include:
- Allow players to rename villages and add descriptions.
- Add a main menu, which allows starting a new game and loading save files.
- Finally, start implementing the game's core village/craft functionality.
